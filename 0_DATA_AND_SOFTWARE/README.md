## Software and Tools
Some programs are neccesary to work:

0. Python: For absolutely everything. Python is essential, even for IRAF.
1. IRAF: For image reduction, edition, co-addition and another features. With Python, we get Pyraf, IRAF with Python interface.
2. DS9: For image and catalog visualization.
3. SEXtractor: For detection, photometry and catalog creation.
4. SCAMP: For astrometric calibration.
5. Anaconda: To obtain Jupyter Notebook, a well-looked Python interface
6. TOPCAT: To visualize, edit and crossmatch catalogues.

In the repository there'll be documentation about some of the softwares and tools, how to install them and how to use them.
