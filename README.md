# MACSJ0416.1-2403 Photometry
This repository contains the most important tools and codes to perform the photometric analysis of galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403. This project corresponds to my bachelor's thesis project at Universidad de Concepción, Chile.

## Collaborators
My supervisors professors were Dr. Ricardo Demarco (Universidad de Concepción, Chile) and Dr. Daniela Olave-Rojas (Universidad de Talca, Chile). During the years I also received help from my undergraduate partners Ian Baeza and Diego Salvador, Master studentes at Universidad de Concepción, Chile.

## Project Timeline
The project is divided into several steps:

    0. Download the data
    1. Image reduction and calibration
    2. Astrometric Calibration
    3. Photometric Calibration
    4. Limiting magnitudes and comparison with literature
    5. Characteristic luminosity
