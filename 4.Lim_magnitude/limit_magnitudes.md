# Limit Magnitudes Notebook
The jupyter notebook calculates the limit magnitud of the photometric catalogues produced by SEXtractor. This notebook also performs photometric calibration for all the objects in the catalogues.

The procedure is as follows:

    1. Apply photometric calibration to the detected objects.
    2. Calculate "Signal-to-Noise" ratio to all the objects:
